# Hellu! ðŸ‘‹ I'm BabyYoda-bee-boop

## ðŸ’» Still figuring things out, one line of code at a time
I'm building my skills one project at a time and I love challenge of making things work.
When I hit a wall it motivates me to I dig deeper and keep trying different approaches until it clicks.
Finally getting that piece of code to do what you want it to is so satisfying

## ðŸš€ Always learning something new (whether in tech or expanding my hobbies)
Fueled with curiosity, I love trying out different technologies and seeing what I can build with them.
Right now I'm focused on learning the basics, but I'm curious about pretty much everything in tech.

## ðŸŒ¿ Life outside of code ðŸ¦‰
I spend a lot of time outdoors and have a very soft spot for animals.
For me, spending time in nature and animals is very grounding and it fuels me with enery and positive mindset.
Also, my pets make excellent rubber duckies when I'm talking through coding problems ðŸ¦†quack-quack ðŸ˜†
